				Preprocessing

					It's always really exciting to find the exact perfect dataset for what you need. Unfortunately, before you can begin to explore it, you
					typically have to go through the frustrating preprocessing stage and clean it up so that it's easy to work with. Preprocessing can come in
					many forms from playing with data types to working with text to make sure the formatting is consistent and that it's not full of unnecessary
					nonsense.
				</br>
				</br>
					One way to clean up text is using regular expressions, little patterns that can be used to search through text. Here are some ways that
					you can use regular expressions to clean up your data.
				</div>
			<div class="section">
				Putting together regular expressions patterns
			</div>
			<div class="list">
			</br>
				To get started, let's take a look at some of the most common pieces that you can put together into regular expressions.
			</br>
			</br>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">\w, \d, \s:</span> These patterns can be used to search for words, digits, and white space respectively.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">[a-z], [A-Z], [0-9]</span> These patterns find all lowercase letters, all capital letters, and all digits.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">^(pattern)</span> The carat serves as an anchor to mark that we are looking for something at the beginning of a string.
					It is most useful when working with so many strings that it wouldn't be easy to look at the beginning of each string separately.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span class="bold">(pattern)$</span> The dollar sign serves as an anchor to mark that we are looking for something at the end of a string.
					Like the carat, it is most useful when working with many strings.
				</li>
			</ul>
			</br>
			<span class="bold">r'^\d'</span> is an example pattern you could put together using these pieces. This pattern will match a string of digits
			that occurs at the beginning of a string. To learn more about what goes into a regulaar expression, check out

			<div class="section">
				Some useful RegEx patterns
			</br>
			</div>
			</br>
				Now that you understand the basics of RegEx, here's a few patterns that may help you when cleaning data. Depending on what you're doing,
				you may either want to replace the phrases these patterns match with generic phrases (so, for example, you could replace a URL simply with
				the phrase 'URL') or just collect the phrases together.
			</br>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">r'http.*'</span>: This pattern matches all URLs.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">r'<.*[^A-Za-z]>|</[A-Za-z]>'</span>: This pattern matches all HTML tags.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">r'[^\w\s]'</span>: This patter matches anything that isn't a word or a whitespace. This includes digits, punctuation,
						and even emojis.
					</li>
				</br>
				</br>
					With these simple regex patterns, you can get started cleaning up your data to be just right for your project.
