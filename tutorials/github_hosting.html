            Head over to <a href="https://github.com/join?source=header-home">GitHub</a> and create your account.
            You'll have to <b>enter</b> some basic information like your username and email address.

              Tip: for your username, use your full name or something distinctive and easy to remember

            <b>Download</b> the correct version of <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub desktop</a>
            for your operating system. Once the download is complete, <b>log in</b> using the username
            and password you just created.

          <li>
            If you haven't already, set up your project files within one folder to avoid broken pathways.
            This way, when you set up your repository folder you'll be able to move them over without any problem.

            Open up GitHub desktop and sign in. In the upper left-hand corner of your screen click <i>File</i> and then <i>New Repository</i>.

              Tip: Mac users can also user the keyboard shortcut Cmnd + N to open up the option to create a new repository.

            Use <i>[username].github.io</i>, the name of the project folder, as the name for the repository.

          <li>
            When asked for the local path, choose where on your computer you would like your repository to be
            created. GitHub will create a new empty folder for your site here with the name [username].github.io.

            Click create repository to create your first GitHub repository!

            At this point you have two important folders â€” your working folder, where you've set up your project
            files so far, and your repository folder that GitHub has just set up. <b>Move</b> or <b>copy</b> all of the project
            files from your working folder to your repository.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Open</b> GitHub desktop back up. In the left-hand <i>sidebar</i> you should see all of your project files listed
            as changes. Below the list of files, in the lower left-hand corner, type in a brief summary and description
            of the changes you've made to your repository.
            <br>
            <span class="Tip">
              Tip: It may not seem important now to type in a meaningful description of your changes but as you move
              forward and continue making changes and additions to your site, it'll be helpful to know what you
              did when.
            </span>
          </li>
          <li>
             Below, click <i>Commit to master</i>. Under the button you should get a
             small message that tells you that your changes have been committed.
          </li>
          <li>
             Click 'Publish repository' at the top of the page. Your site should be up and running now!
          </li>
          <li>
             Visit <i>[username].github.io</i>, share it with your friends and family, put it on business cards, whatever!
             The internet is your oyster now, captain.
