					Voyant is an exciting tool for taking closer look at a number of texts all at once. The website gives you a number of options for how
					you'd like to pull up the texts you'd like to work with on the site from simply copying and pasting the body of text to finding text from
					URLs to uploading documents. The best way to get started with looking at the features of the sites, though, is with one of Voyant's premade
					corpuses.
				</br>
				</br>
					In the bottom lefthand corner of the <i>Add Texts</i> box, click <span class="bold">Open</span> to choose one of the corpuses that Voyant
					has already prepared. Select your favourite in the dropdown menu and then click <span class="bold">Open</span> to start working. This option
					is helpful if you'd like to become familiar with the tools rather than work with a specific text.

				Now that you've added your texts, it's time to work with them. Voyant has a lot of cool built in tools but they're arranged rather
				confusingly. Thankfully, the tools page is broken into five distinct sections so it's easy to walk through them one by one.
				<br>
				<br>
			<div class="section">
				Summary, Documents, Phrases
				<br>
				(bottom left-hand corner)
			</div>
				<br>
				While it's a bit out of the way, the bottom left-hand
				tab is a great place to get started. Here there are three main tools.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Summary:</span> The summary tool is handy for comparing the length and complexity of different documents.
						It will also tell you the most frequent words within a corpus and the words that are most unique to each separate document within it.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Documents:</span> The documents tool is one of the less exciting tools but it's one of the most important.
						This tool will show you the length of each document in the corpus. Click <span class="bold">Modify</span> below to add, remove,
						or filter documents from your corpus.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="bold">Phrases:</span> The phrases tool shows you where phrases are repeated throughout the corpus and the
						length of these phrases.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="section">
					Contexts, Bubblelines, Correlations
					<br>
					(bottom right-hand corner)
				</div>
					Use these tools to get a better sense of how specific words are situated within the text.
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Contexts:</span> With this tool, you can input any word or group of words and see the phrases that come before and
							after them throughout the text.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Bubblelines:</span> Input any word or group of words to see where they appear most frequently in each document.
							The document here is visualized as a line while bubbles of different sizes represent the words on the line depending on their frequencies
							at certain points in the text.
						</li>
						<li>
							<span class="bold">Correlations:</span> For any word, here you can see how often its frequency varies with the variations in frequency of
							other words. You can also see how significant, in statistical terms, this correlation is.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="section">
						Cirrus, Terms, Links
						<br>
						(top left-hand corner)
					</div>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">Cirrus:</span> This tool gives you a handy word cloud that shows how frequent words are within the corpus or within
								a specific document. You can use the dropdown below to change what document you would like to work with and use the slider to change how
								many items appear in your word cloud.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">Terms:</span> Similar to <span class="bold">Phrases</span>, this tool shows you where words are repeated throughout
								the corpus. It also shows you which documents the words are most frequently used in.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="bold">Links:</span> Enter a word or set of words and get a nice web-like visual that shows what other words tend to appear
								with these words. You can use the slider to change the number of words that appear.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<div class="section">
							Reader, TermsBerry
							<br>
							(top middle)
						</div>
							<br>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="bold">Reader:</span> Read through your corpus. Click any word to see its use in phrases within the document in
									<span class="bold">Phrases</span> below and to see its frequency throughout the document in <span class="bold">Trends</span>
									to the right.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="bold">TermsBerry:</span> This tool shows the most frequent words in a text. Hover over any word bubble and the
									other words that appear with it most frequently will light up too.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="section">
								Trends, Document Terms
								<br>
								(top right-hand corner)
							</div>
								<br>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<span class="bold">Trends:</span> Enter any word or set of words to see how frequently they occur in the corpus or at any point
										within a document. Using the display option, you can change how this is visualized â€” whether as a line graph, as a bar graph, or
										something else entirely.
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="bold">Document Terms:</span> Similar to <span class="bold">Trends</span>, this tool will show you the relative
										frequency of each word you choose to examine across each document in a corpus. Here, though, your results are presented in a
										table rather than in a graph.
									</li>
								</ul>
