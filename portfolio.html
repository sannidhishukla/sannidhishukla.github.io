          His image popped up not only during other performers’ tributes to the late rapper, but also on
          Instagrammable photo-ops set up throughout the festival."</i>

          <i>"As far as rock stars go, Beck must be one of the most supremely awkward ones out there.
            He’s certainly more likely to adjust his pants onstage than he is to bust a move.
            His showmanship consists mainly of taking small leaps to the side with caution and
            sliding back and forth with uncertainty."</i>

          "Nearly every song on the album writhes to the rhythm of its own clanging electronic pulse.
          Sometimes this movement is delicately, barely concealed under the impossibly smooth vocals.
          Other times, the mechanics of SOPHIE’s production are laid bare, ready to be appreciated as fine clockwork might be."

            and highlights the subtle magic that exists in Oakland. The fact that all three of these films were
            released within the same calendar year speaks to the urgency of the mission."</i>

          must be especially resilient to survive in the famously male-dominated entertainment and media industries."
